At this stage, the latest released version is considered supported. Older versions may not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, please report it privately by contacting the project maintainer through the channels listed in the project repository (for example, the repository owner on GitHub).

Please include as much detail as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any possible mitigations or workarounds

We will aim to respond to security reports within a reasonable timeframe. Once the issue has been investigated and a fix is available, we will coordinate a disclosure process that balances the needs of users and the broader community.

Thank you for helping to keep this project and its users safe.
